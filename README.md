# üßµ Design of Experiments: Additive Manufacturing (PLA Tensile Strength)

The project explores how key 3D printing parameters‚Äîspecifically infill percentage and print speed‚Äîimpact the tensile strength of PLA parts produced via additive manufacturing.

## üîç Problem Statement

This study investigates how **infill percentage** and **print speed** affect the **tensile strength** of PLA parts manufactured using 3D printing. A full factorial experiment was designed and executed with the following setup:

- **Factors**:
  - **Infill Percentage**: 30%, 80%
  - **Print Speed**: 1500, 2000, 2500 mm/min

- **Response Variable**: Tensile strength (MPa)

## üß™ Experimental Design

- **Design Type**: Full factorial (2 √ó 3)
- **Replications**: 3 per treatment combination
- **Total Samples**: 18 ASTM D638 Type V dogbone specimens  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted using `PROC GLM` in SAS

| Treatment # | Infill % | Print Speed (mm/min) |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1           | 30       | 1500                 |
| 2           | 30       | 2000                 |
| 3           | 30       | 2500                 |
| 4           | 80       | 1500                 |
| 5           | 80       | 2000                 |
| 6           | 80       | 2500                 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Calibration & Data Transformation

To satisfy ANOVA assumptions, we evaluated different response transformations:

- **Transformations Tried**: `log`, `sqrt`, `inverse`
- **Final Choice**: **Inverse transformation**
  - Effectively addressed heteroscedasticity and non-normality

## üìå Key Findings

### Main Effects (Tukey Pairwise Comparisons)
- The mean max. stress at **30% infill** is significantly different from that at **80% infill**.
- For **print speed**, the mean max. stress at **1500 mm/min** and **2000 mm/min** are statistically similar.
- The mean max. stress at **2000 mm/min** and **2500 mm/min** are also similar.
- However, the mean max. stress at **1500 mm/min** and **2500 mm/min** differ significantly.

### Pre-Selected Contrasts (Bonferroni Method)
- Mean max. stress when print speed is **less than 2500 mm/min** differs significantly from when it is **2500 mm/min**.
- Mean max. stress when print speed is **greater than 1500 mm/min** differs significantly from when it is **1500 mm/min**.
- This difference between print speeds (<2500 vs. 2500 mm/min) is consistent across both infill levels (30% and 80%).
